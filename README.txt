ForestMHC Training Data, Version 1.0

The data herein were assembled from publicly available datasets in early 2018, as cited in 'dataRefs.txt.' These peptides were found by sampling the immunopeptidome of human cells by mass spectrometry.

Deconvolution of polyallelic data and filtering were performed as outlined in 'Predicting peptide presentations by major histocompatibility complex class I using one million peptides,' found at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/18/349282

The peptides contained in testData_SK-OV-3.csv were newly generated for validation of ForestMHC and were not included in the training set. After deconvolution and filtering, these peptides were used for unbiased testing of ForestMHC.
