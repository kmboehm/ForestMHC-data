ForestMHC Training Data, Version 1.0

The data herein were assembled from publicly available datasets in early 2018, as cited in 'dataRefs.txt.' These peptides were found by sampling the immunopeptidome of human cells by mass spectrometry.

Deconvolution of polyallelic data and filtering were performed as outlined in 'Predicting peptide presentations by major histocompatibility complex class I using one million peptides,' found at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/18/349282
